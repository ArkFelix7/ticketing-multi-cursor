# JSON Parsing Error Fix Documentation

## Issue Overview

The application was experiencing the following errors in the mailbox sync process:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input
    at syncMailboxes (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./components/mailbox-sync-scheduler.tsx:65:45)

Error: Invalid JSON response
    at syncMailboxes (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./components/mailbox-sync-scheduler.tsx:76:23)
```

These errors occurred when trying to parse the response from the `/api/mailbox/sync` endpoint.

## Root Causes

1. Empty or malformed JSON responses from the API endpoint
2. Lack of proper error handling when parsing JSON responses
3. Missing content-type headers in some responses
4. Lack of validation before attempting to parse JSON

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced JSON Response Handling in Client

Updated `mailbox-sync-scheduler.tsx` to:
- Check for content length before attempting to parse
- Use a two-step approach (get text, then parse) for safer JSON handling
- Provide fallback values when content is empty or invalid
- Add specific error handling for different types of fetch/parsing errors
- Implement timeout handling with AbortController
- Improve UI feedback for different error states

### 2. API Response Standardization

Updated `api/mailbox/sync/route.ts` to:
- Always return valid JSON objects
- Ensure consistent response structure
- Add type checking before returning responses
- Wrap non-object responses in a standardized format

### 3. API Middleware Improvements

Updated `api-middleware.ts` to:
- Add a `withJsonResponseCheck` middleware
- Ensure all API responses include the correct content-type header
- Properly wrap all responses in NextResponse.json()

### 4. Created Testing Tools

1. Created API testing script (`scripts/test-mailbox-sync-api.ts`)
2. Created browser-based API tester (`public/api-tester.html`)
3. Added better error reporting in components

## Testing The Fix

### Using the API Tester

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/api-tester.html](http://localhost:3000/api-tester.html)
3. Click "Test POST Endpoint" and "Test GET Endpoint" to verify JSON responses

### Using the Test Script

Run the following command:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-mailbox-sync-api.ts
```

## Security Notes

During the fix implementation, we discovered hardcoded email credentials in `demo.txt`. These have been:
1. Properly moved to environment variables
2. Removed from the demo file to prevent security issues
3. A warning was added to the demo file about not storing credentials in plaintext

## Future Recommendations

1. Add automated API tests to prevent regression
2. Consider adding a global fetch wrapper with standardized error handling
3. Implement API response validation using a schema library like Zod
4. Add monitoring for API failures to detect issues early
