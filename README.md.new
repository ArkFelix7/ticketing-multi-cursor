# Multi-Tenant Ticketing System

This is a multi-tenant ticketing system that includes email integration for automatic ticket creation from incoming emails.

## Key Features

- Multi-tenant architecture with company isolation
- Email integration with Gmail/SMTP
- Automatic ticket creation from emails
- Auto-reply functionality
- Dashboard for ticket management
- User authentication and authorization
- Company-specific settings

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js 16+
2. PostgreSQL database (or Supabase)
3. Gmail account for email integration

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Email Integration

For detailed instructions on setting up email integration, see [TESTING-EMAIL-INTEGRATION.md](./TESTING-EMAIL-INTEGRATION.md).

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React Server Components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Email**: IMAP/SMTP integration with nodemailer and imap-simple

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
# Test email integration
npx tsx scripts/test-smtp-auto-reply.ts --once

# Test mailbox sync
npx tsx scripts/sync-mailboxes.ts
```

## Logging

The system includes a structured logging system with the following levels:

- `debug`: Detailed information, typically only valuable during development
- `info`: Confirmation that things are working as expected
- `warn`: Indication of potential issues 
- `error`: Error conditions that need attention

Logs are printed to the console but can be easily extended to log to a file or external service.

## Security Considerations

- Email passwords should be stored securely (encrypted in the database)
- Use App Passwords instead of regular Gmail passwords
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all user inputs
- Protect against XSS and CSRF attacks
