# Email Ticketing System: Gaps, Flaws, and Roadmap for a Flawless Experience

## 1. Email Processing & Visibility

### Current Flaws
- **Email disappears from inbox after ticket creation:**
  - Once a ticket is created, the email is marked as `isProcessed: true` and is no longer visible in the inbox UI. This breaks the expectation that users can always see all conversations, regardless of ticket status.
- **No conversation/thread view:**
  - Emails and their replies are not grouped as conversations, making it hard to follow the full context of a support request.
- **Manual ticket creation required:**
  - Users must click on an email and then manually create a ticket, even for new incoming emails. This is inefficient and error-prone.
- **No quick preview or persistent view:**
  - Once a ticket is created, the original email content is not easily accessible from the inbox or ticket view.

### Recommendations
- **Inbox should show all emails, with ticket status indicator:**
  - Add a `ticketStatus` or `ticketId` field to emails. Show all emails in the inbox, but visually indicate if a ticket has been created.
- **Implement conversation/threading:**
  - Group emails by `messageId`, `inReplyTo`, and `references` headers.
- **Auto-create tickets for new emails:**
  - New incoming emails should automatically create tickets, and the UI should reflect this instantly.
- **Allow viewing email content from both inbox and ticket views:**
  - Ensure the email body and attachments are always accessible, even after ticket creation.

## 2. Ticket Creation & Management

### Current Flaws
- **Foreign key constraint errors:**
  - Tickets sometimes fail to be created due to invalid or missing `creatorId`.
- **No robust fallback for system user:**
  - If the system user does not exist, the process fails instead of falling back to a company owner or creating a system user.
- **No ticket assignment logic:**
  - Tickets are not automatically assigned to agents or teams.
- **No SLA or escalation tracking:**
  - There is no mechanism to track response times or escalate overdue tickets.

### Recommendations
- **Always ensure a valid creator for tickets:**
  - Use a fallback mechanism: system user → company owner → create system user if missing.
- **Implement auto-assignment and escalation:**
  - Use round-robin or load-based assignment for new tickets.
  - Add SLA timers and escalation rules.

## 3. User Interface & Experience

### Current Flaws
- **Error-prone email display:**
  - UI code assumes arrays are always present (e.g., `.join()` on undefined), causing runtime errors.
- **No real-time updates:**
  - Inbox does not update automatically when new emails arrive or tickets are created.
- **Poor mobile and accessibility support:**
  - UI is not optimized for mobile or keyboard navigation.
- **No visual distinction for ticketed emails:**
  - Users cannot easily see which emails have tickets created.

### Recommendations
- **Safe access for all email fields:**
  - Use utility functions to safely handle arrays and optional fields.
- **Implement real-time updates:**
  - Use WebSockets or polling to refresh inbox and ticket views.
- **Improve UI/UX:**
  - Add mobile responsiveness, keyboard shortcuts, and accessibility features.
- **Show ticket status in inbox:**
  - Add icons or badges to indicate ticket status for each email.

## 4. Email Handling & Processing

### Current Flaws
- **Limited attachment support:**
  - Attachments are not always saved or displayed correctly.
- **No email threading:**
  - Replies and related emails are not grouped together.
- **No HTML sanitization:**
  - Displaying raw HTML emails can be a security risk.
- **No customizable auto-reply templates:**
  - Auto-replies are hardcoded and not company-specific.

### Recommendations
- **Improve attachment handling:**
  - Save and display all attachments, including inline images.
- **Implement email threading:**
  - Use `messageId`, `inReplyTo`, and `references` to group emails.
- **Sanitize HTML emails:**
  - Use a library like `sanitize-html` to prevent XSS.
- **Support customizable auto-reply templates:**
  - Allow companies to define their own auto-reply messages.

## 5. Authentication & Security

### Current Flaws
- **Credentials stored in plain text:**
  - IMAP/SMTP passwords are not encrypted.
- **No OAuth support for mailboxes:**
  - Only basic authentication is supported.
- **No role-based access control:**
  - All users have similar permissions.
- **No audit logging:**
  - User actions are not tracked for security or compliance.

### Recommendations
- **Encrypt sensitive credentials:**
  - Store passwords encrypted at rest.
- **Add OAuth support:**
  - Support modern authentication for Gmail, Outlook, etc.
- **Implement RBAC:**
  - Define roles and permissions for users, agents, and admins.
- **Add audit logging:**
  - Track all critical actions in the system.

## 6. Error Handling & Reliability

### Current Flaws
- **Poor error recovery:**
  - Failures in ticket creation or email sync can leave the system in an inconsistent state.
- **No retry or transaction support:**
  - Operations are not retried or wrapped in transactions.
- **Limited logging:**
  - Not all errors are logged with enough context.

### Recommendations
- **Wrap critical operations in transactions:**
  - Use Prisma transactions for email and ticket creation.
- **Implement retry logic:**
  - Retry failed syncs and ticket creations.
- **Improve logging:**
  - Add structured logs for all major actions and errors.

---

## 7. Performance & Scalability

### Current Flaws
- **Sequential email processing:**
  - Emails are processed one at a time, which is slow for high volume.
- **No job queue or background processing:**
  - All processing is synchronous and blocks the main thread.
- **No caching or rate limiting:**
  - Repeated queries and no protection against abuse.

### Recommendations
- **Parallelize email processing:**
  - Use async queues or worker pools.
- **Implement job queue:**
  - Use BullMQ or similar for background tasks.
- **Add caching and rate limiting:**
  - Use Redis or in-memory cache for frequent queries.

---

## 8. Integration & Extensibility

### Current Flaws
- **No webhooks or API for external integrations:**
  - Cannot notify or integrate with other systems.
- **No plugin or automation system:**
  - Cannot extend or automate workflows easily.

### Recommendations
- **Add webhook support:**
  - Notify external systems on ticket creation, updates, etc.
- **Build automation rules engine:**
  - Allow custom triggers and actions for tickets and emails.

---

## 9. Monitoring & Analytics

### Current Flaws
- **No health checks or monitoring endpoints:**
  - Cannot easily monitor system health.
- **No analytics or reporting:**
  - No visibility into ticket volume, response times, or agent performance.

### Recommendations
- **Add health check endpoints:**
  - Expose `/api/health` for monitoring.
- **Implement analytics and reporting:**
  - Track key metrics and provide dashboards.

---

## 10. Documentation & Onboarding

### Current Flaws
- **Limited documentation:**
  - No comprehensive guides for users or developers.
- **No onboarding flows:**
  - New users and admins lack guidance.

### Recommendations
- **Write detailed documentation:**
  - Cover setup, usage, troubleshooting, and development.
- **Add onboarding flows:**
  - Guide new users through mailbox setup, ticketing, and best practices.

## Action Plan

### Immediate Fixes
- Show all emails in inbox, with ticket status indicator
- Auto-create tickets for new emails
- Always allow viewing email content from inbox and ticket
- Fix all unsafe array access in UI
- Ensure system user fallback for ticket creation

### Short-term Improvements

- Add real-time inbox updates
- Improve attachment and HTML email handling
- Add RBAC and audit logging

### Long-term Enhancements
- Job queue for background processing
- Analytics and reporting dashboard
- Webhook and automation support
