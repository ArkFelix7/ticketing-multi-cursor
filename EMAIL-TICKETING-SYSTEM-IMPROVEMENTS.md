# Email Ticketing System Improvements Implementation

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Auto-Create Tickets for New Emails
- Updated `lib/mailbox-sync.ts` to automatically create tickets for new incoming emails
- Implemented proper ticket threading by using the email's message ID, references, and in-reply-to headers
- Added code to link new emails to existing tickets if they are part of the same conversation
- Enhanced fallback logic for system user creation

### 2. HTML Email Sanitization
- Added `EmailUtils.sanitizeHtml()` in `lib/email-utils.ts` using isomorphic-dompurify
- Implemented secure HTML rendering with proper XSS protection
- Added `getSafeHtml()` method to safely display HTML email content
- Applied HTML sanitization during email processing

### 3. Email UI Improvements
- Enhanced the inbox UI to show ALL emails (both ticketed and unticketed)
- Added visual indicators for ticketed emails (badges and border styling)
- Implemented filtering options (All, No Ticket, Has Ticket)
- Fixed unsafe property access issues with proper null checks
- Added links to navigate directly to related tickets
- Added CSS styling for better HTML email display

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Implemented auto-refresh functionality that polls for new emails every 30 seconds
- Added silent refresh mechanism to avoid UX disruption during updates
- Maintained email selection state during background refreshes
- Cleanup of refresh intervals when component unmounts

### 5. API and Type Enhancements
- Updated the Email type interface to include ticket-related fields
- Ensured ticket creation no longer removes emails from the inbox
- Added proper error handling throughout the system

## Future Improvements to Consider

1. **WebSocket Integration**: For true real-time updates instead of polling
2. **Pagination**: For better performance with large inbox volumes
3. **Enhanced Threading**: Improved conversation grouping and visualization
4. **Smart Ticket Assignment**: Automatic routing of tickets based on content or rules
5. **Mobile Optimization**: More responsive design for mobile devices
6. **Attachment Handling**: Better previewing and downloading of email attachments
7. **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across emails and tickets

## How to Test the Changes

1. Sync one or more mailboxes to receive emails
2. Observe that new emails automatically create tickets
3. Reply to existing tickets via email to see threading in action
4. Verify HTML emails display properly and safely
5. Check filter functionality to view specific emails
6. Validate that emails are no longer removed from the inbox when tickets are created
7. Wait for auto-refresh to check for real-time updates
